What info do we need to store. What input will there be? What will the program output? 
No log in system needed. We need to keep track of each course, the students in that course, the dates.
Each student can be on time, absent (excused or not excused), or late. Sorting alphabetically by name
but the instructor would also like to be able to see the names in a custom order, perhaps roughly laid out by seat location.
Keep track of frequency of absenses and be able to sort them based on that. 
The instructor wants to be able to see summaries of who was absent on a particular day,
who are the most frequently absent, and get detailed records about any student in a class.
All he wants is the students names, who was there for each particular class that day. 
He'll pick a course, and then he'll pick his method. 
At start, does he want to take attendance or pick a summary. Check attendance from the course as a whole, 
check attendance from a particular day, or check attendace for a particular student.
Create a menu, select course, then select out of the 4 options.
